## Data availability
The data used in this work can be found in the file *'Dataset - Mayrs DB.csv'*.

## Code availability
The various algorithm models can be found in the *'net.py'* file.

The code for the graph neural network is in the GNN folder, just open *'GSGAT-re.py'* and run the script directly. 

The machine learning script is in the *'Machine learning'* folder and the script can be run directly in *'main.py'*. 

Note that please change the parameter ***'db_file_path'*** in scripts to the local location where the dataset is located.

In addition, we share scripts for data processing, analysis and visualization in the file **' Machine Learning - load_dataset.py'**.
